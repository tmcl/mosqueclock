This is fdlibm (Sun's Freely Distributed libm) with the relevant 
functions rename to sin2 cos2 etc. 

Why? Because I want the Java and Haskell sin, cos etc to match up.
GNU libm and FD libm have different results (e.g. if sine is GNU
sin and sine2 is fdlibm sin: 

	the sine of 2.680464560029405 is 0.4449586553202932
	the sine2 of 2.680464560029405 is 0.4449586553202933
	the sine of 40057197673b4e7c is 3fdc7a33de2b0f16
	the sine2 of 40057197673b4e7c is 3fdc7a33de2b0f17

In interpreting that, please take careful note of the hex, which is
the in-memory representation of the decimal numbers show in ambiguous form)
